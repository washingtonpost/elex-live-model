    """
    The bootstrap election model.

    This model uses ordinary least squares regression for point predictions and the bootstrap to generate
    prediction intervals.

    In this setup, we are modeling normalized two party margin.
    But because we need to sum our estimand from the unit level to the aggregate level, we need
    to be able to convert normalized margin to unormalized margin (since normalized margins don't sum).
    This means on the unit level we will be modeling unnormalized margin and on the aggregate level normalized margin.

    We have found that instead of modeling the unit margin directly,
    decomposing the estimand into two quantites works better because the linear
    model assumption is more plausible for each individually.
    The two quantities are normalized margin (y) and a turnout factor (z)
            y = (D^{Y} - R^{Y}) / (D^{Y} + D^{Y})
            z = (D^{Y} + R^{Y}) / (D^{Y'} + R^{Y'})
    where Y is the year we are modeling and Y' is the previous election year.

    If we define weights to be the total two party turnout in a previous election:
        w = (D^{Y'} + R^{Y'}) -> w * y * z = (D^{Y} - R^{Y})
    so (w * y * z) is the unnormalized margin.

    We define our model as:
        y_i = f_y(x) + epsilon_y(x)
        z_i = f_z(x) + epsilon_z(x)
    where f_y(x) and f_z(x) are ordinary least squares regressions
    and the epsilons are contest (state/district) level random effects.

        Computes unit level point predictions and runs the bootstrap to generate quantities needed for
        prediction intervals.

        The bootstrap generally re-samples the observed data with replacement in order to generate synthentic
            "bootstrap" datasets, which can be used to estimate the sampling distribution of a quantity that we
            are interested in.
        Our implementation is the stratified residual bootstrap. The residual bootstrap samples residuals of a
            model (instead of the original dataset).
            This is preferable in a regression setting because it removes the the component of the observation that is
            not random.
        We use the stratified bootstrap because our units are not independent and identically distributed, which means
            that we cannot assign the error of any unit to any other unit (e.g. the residual for an urban unit would
            likely not fit for a rural unit). For now, this model stratifies on county classification
            (rural/urban/suburban).

        Generally we are interested in predicting functions of:
                w * y * z = weights * normalized_margin * turnout_factor = unnormalized_margin

        There are three cases:
            1) In the unit case we are interested in the unnormalized margin:
                    w_i * y_i * z_i
            2) In the aggregate (e.g. state aggregation) case we are interested in the normalized sum of the
               unnormalized margin of units
                    (sum_{i = 1}^N w_i * y_i * z_i) / (sum_{i = 1}^N w_i * z_i)
            3) In the national case we are interested in an interval over the sum of electoral votes generated by
               the predictions
                    sum_{s = 1}^{51} sigmoid{sum_{i = 1}^{N_s} w_i * y_i * z_i} * ev_s

        Our point prediction for each is:
            1) w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}
            2) (sum_{i = 1}^N w_i * hat{y_i} * hat_{z_i}) / (sum_{i = 1}^N w_i hat{z_i})
            3) sum_{s = 1}^{51} sigmoid{sum_{i=1}^{N_s} w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}} * ev_s
        remember that our model for y_i, z_i is OLS plus a contest random effect:
                y_i = f_y(x) + epsilon_y(x)
                z_i = f_z(x) + epsilon_z(x)
        this means that:
                hat{y_i} = hat{f_y(x)} + hat{epsilon_y(x)}
                hat{z_i} = hat{f_z(x)} + hat{epsilon_z(x)}

        As point predictions, this function only computes:
            1) w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}
            2) w_i * hat{z_i}
        which are then used in the respective prediction functions

        We are also interested in generating prediction intervals for the quantities, we do that by bootstrapping
            the error in our predictions and then taking the appropriate percentiles of those errors.
            The errors we are interested in are between the true quantity and our prediction:

        There are three cases that mirror the cases above (error between prediction and true quantity)
            1) w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i} - w_i * y_i * z_i
            2) ((sum_{i = 1}^N w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}) / (sum_{i = 1}^n w_i hat{z_i}) -
               (sum_{i = 1}^N w_i * y_i * z_i) / (sum_{i = 1}^n w_i z_i))
            3) (sum_{s = 1}^{51} sigmoid{sum_{i=1}^{N_s} w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}} *
                ev_s - sum_{s = 1}^{51} sigmoid{sum_{i=1}^{N_s} w_i * y_i * z_i} * ev_s)

        In order to keep this model as flexible as possible for all potential cases, this function generates
            bootstrap estimates for:
            1) w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}
            2) w_i * y_i * z_i
            3) w_i * hat{z_i}
            4) w_i * z_i
        and store those so that we can later compute prediction interevals for any function of these quantities in their
            respective functions.

        In a normal setting the bootstrap works by assuming that our fitted predictions
            (e.g. w_i * hat{y_i} * hat{z_i}) is now the true value. Then using the bootstrap to generate synthentic
            samples (e.g. w_i hat{y_i}^b * hat{z_i}^b) and computing the error between the two.
            This would give us a confidence interval (ie. the error between a quantity and it's mean),
            but we are interested in a prediction interval, which means we also need to take into account
            the additional uncertainty in sampling new y_i and z_i.

        This means that our new "true" quantity (the equivalent of w_i * y_i * z_i)
            needs a new fresh sampled uncertainty, so we sample new test errors
                residuals_{y, i}^{b}, residuals_{z, i}^{b}
            in order to compute:

        # We bootstrap epsilons using the parametric bootstrap. Our procedure for bootstrapping the deltas is more
        # complicated.

        # The stratified bootstrap assumes that the final model residuals (delta) are independent and identically
        # distributed per strata. So we now need to generate new bootstrapped deltas for each unit in each strata.

        # Instead of sampling the deltas directly with replacement we generate a probability distributionsfor each
        # strata. We convert the deltas into uniform random variables using the distributions CDF
        # (probability integral transform), we then re-sample the uniforms with replacement and then convert the
        # uniform random variables back into deltas using the PPF of the distribution (inverse CDF).
        # We do this because we have two deltas to sample (delta_z and delta_y) by sampling the observed CDFs we
        # can maintain the correlation between the y and z deltas.

        #   (a big y error and a big z error co-occur)
        # This approach using uniform random variables allows us to smooth over the distribution in cases where we
        # have only seen very few obserations per strata. We can also impose a worst/best case scenario by adding an
        # additional datapoint for each stratum when generating the distribution.

        # we only want re-sample deltas in each strata (ie. rural counties should only receive errors from rural
        # counties, same for suburban and urban). this means that we need to generate error distributions
